    <p>There arent many machines that inspire awe and envy quite as effectively as a Ducati 916 Campione del mondo Superbike. In fact there arent many machines that become legends before they even got out of the box as was the case when the 916 was unveiled to the public in late 1993. With development beginning in the late 80s when the 851 was still the king of the V-twin superbike class the 916 was destined for greatness in many aspects including design, style, performance, and racing pedigree. Designed from the ground up as a race winner, the 916 was blessed with prodigious performance for the day, and stunning styling penned by Massimo Tamburini and the Cagiva Research Centre. The 916 was achingly beautiful and well ahead of the curve when compared to the portly and conservative styling of contemporary mid 90s sportbikes. Here was a purposeful, clean and perfectly executed machine without compromise introduced into a sea of overweight and ponderous competitors.</p>

    <p>The 916s greatest asset is its focus and lack of compromise, which can also be its greatest weakness in daily use. This machine was designed to win races and dominate the competition, it was not built for puttering through city traffic or suffering ham fisted riders. Where Japanese superbikes are generally easy to ride and more or less forgiving of minor errors, and are even docile when treated with respect, the 916 is a snarling, raucous, unforgiving purebred that will not suffer fools gladly.</p>

    <p>The motor here is one of the finest designs to emerge from Borgo Panigale in the 20th century, providing a scintillating powerband that the modest dyno charts can never convey. One thing that strikes you is the rev-happy nature of the 916cc mill, despite the fact this is a big twin. The motor spins up freely and effortlessly, and produces most of its power in the upper rev range. Such is the benefit of desmodromic valve actuation that is lost on most motorcyclists – here is a motor that should feel lazy and punchy, but instead screams to redline with fervour usually reserved for multi-cylinder machines.</p>

    <p>Low end torque is not particularly noteworthy, and is overshadowed by the stupendous driveline lash inherent in a big twin – anything less than 3500 rpm and the bike will shudder and protest your inputs. Midrange is adequate, but a flat spot at 4500-5000 rpm mars stock machines, something easily remedied by a slip on exhaust kit with an off-road EPROM. It is above this where the motor truly shines – from 6000 rpm onward the bike emits a hard-edged roar from the huge ram-air intakes and lunges with ferocity to the 10000 rpm redline. Spinning the motor above 7000 rpm is a revelation, and produces a spine tingling intake howl accompanied by a significant spike in power. The undeadened intake roar of a 916 is one of the most incredible noises one will ever experience, and was lost when the 996 and later bikes got rubber venturi blocks in the intake runners. Redline seems to come on fast and without warning – in typical Ducati fashion, the 13000 rpm tachometer has no marked redline, and the locomotive surge of power in the upper rev band seems to stop abruptly at the cutout rather than tapering off before redline. Despite this, the motor is happy to be short shifted around 7000-8000rpm, and makes plenty of useable grunt from 4000 rpm onward. Vibration is minimal, with only a slight buzziness creeping through the fuel tank in the midrange.  Nothing comes through the bars or the pegs.</p>
